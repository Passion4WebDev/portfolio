                I'm originally from Cambodia. I came to America at the age of 11 year old. I have was
                originally inspired by so many loving families and I was taught so much by my sponsor "The Gold Family".
                They have taught me that freedom comes with a price of hardwork! I hope some day I get to
                say "Thank you for their inspiration, kind loving words and for believing in me".


                I am married to a wonderful and loving husband. We have two beautiful and wonderful daughterers that are
                twin. They are both attending ðŸŒ¹Rose-Hulman institution of Technology as computer science major. They have
                encouraged and inspired me to continue my education in similar field. We have two sweet adorable loving chihuahuas
                puppies.


                I am passion about learning web development, and I never stop learning. I love and enjoy talking to
                people along the way. I love to help them discover or find their passion and or their next chapter in life. It
                is especially incredible to listen and share my stories with wonderful and beautiful people that I come
                across. The way I care for my customers and my incredible drive to do what I love is also the reasons that I
                would go the extra mile. When I am not hard at work for my clients, I enjoy traveling, bicycling, roller 
                skating, and spending time with my family and friends.

                the pilot, enjoy your journey!*****
